## Technical, Implementation, and other Support Questions

### WAI website

Many questions are addressed in documents on the WAI website.
* A good starting place to find relevant resources is the [Accessibility Fundamentals Overview listing page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/) and [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).
* For information on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), see the [WCAG 2 Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
* **For an annotated list of all WAI educational and technical support documents** covering a wide range of topics for content authors, designers, developers, evaluators, testers, managers, policy makers, trainers, educators, web users, advocates, and people with disabilities, see **[[WAI Resources]](/WAI/resources/)**.

### Mailing list for questions
WAI hosts a WAI Interest Goup (IG) mailing list for discussion of digital accessibility issues. The list is open for anyone to read, submit, and respond. If you have a question that might be relevant to the WAI IG list, you can:

-   Search the [WAI IG mailing list archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/) to see the topic has already been addressed sufficiently
-   Read the [Mailing Lists](/WAI/about/groups/waiig/#mailinglist) section of the WAI IG page for guidance on contributing to a comfortable, constructive exchange of ideas; <br>then [Subscribe to the Discussion List](/WAI/about/groups/waiig/#subscribing-and-unsubscribing-to-the-discussion-list) and post appropriate questions

## Feedback on Specific Documents

To submit comments on a specific document:

-   Most WAI web pages have near the bottom a 'Help improve this page' box with links to submit issues or change requests through GitHub, or by email.
-   For W3C guidelines, Notes, and Working Drafts that are under <code>www.w3.org/TR</code>, see 'Status of This Document' section for the email address and/or GitHub repository to send comments.

If you cannot determine where to send comments on a specific document, send an email with the document name in the subject line to: <wai@w3.org> and we will forward your message to the appropriate place. Please include permission to send your email to a publicly-archived email list.

### Feedback on the WAI Website Design

You can submit comments on the overall WAI Web site (www.w3.org/WAI/) either to a W3C WAI staff list or to a public list:

-   <team-site-design@w3.org> (for WAI staff, not public)
-   <wai-site-comments@w3.org> (can be seen by the public)
